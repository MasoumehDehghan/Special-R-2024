#ducciopack2 
This is the first R package made by ourselves

## description of the package
Today we have built our 



#we should explain the function with {} sign
function(x){if(x>0{print("This is a positive number")
}
else if (x<0){
else print ("This is a negative number")
}

#prcomplex <- function(x){
  if(x>0){
  print("This is a positive number")
   }
  else if(x<0){
    print("This is a negative number")
   }
  else if(x==0){
   print("This is just zero! Nor positive nor negative! Have you studied maths at school?")
   }
  }

we can use else to explain to R 
These are the main steps to build the package:
+ Create a new repository 📘
+ Wite functions inside a new folder called R 📁
+ Write functions inside a new folder called R 📁
+ Create a new file called DESCRIPTION 📝
